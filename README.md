This project is a simple Countdown Timer application built using Next.js, HTML, CSS, and TypeScript as part of my 30 Days Project Challenge.

**Features**

1-Set Time Duration: Users can input a custom time in minutes to set the countdown.

2-Start/Pause Timer: The timer can be started and paused with a single click.

3-Reset Timer: Users can reset the timer back to zero.

4-Responsive Design: The application is styled with CSS to look great on different screen sizes.

**Technologies Used**

1-Next.js: A React-based framework for building modern web applications.

2-HTML & CSS: For structuring and styling the UI of the timer.

3-JavaScript: For handling the timer functionality and interactivity

**How It Works**

2-The "Start" button triggers the timer to start counting down.

3-Users can pause and resume the timer using the same button.

4-The "Reset" button will reset the timer to its initial state.
